# KashlApp

*KashlApp* is a cleverly named application derived from the Hebrew acronym "kashlap," meaning "kosher for Passover." The app is designed to aid observant Jews in preparing for Passover by consolidating the laws of training tools for the holiday into a simple, visual, and easy-to-read format.

## Description

KashlApp is a niche application aimed at helping observant Jews of all ages prepare for Passover efficiently. It provides comprehensive laws and guidelines for preparing tools for the holiday, presented in a user-friendly manner. The development of KashlApp, from learning React Native from scratch to launching the web app, was completed within a month. The app was originally intended for the Google Play Store but was converted to a web application on Google Firebase within three days due to technical and bureaucratic challenges. While there are minor glitches, ongoing improvements and additional features are planned for future updates.
